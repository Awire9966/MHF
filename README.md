# MHF
MHF, also referred to as MediaHuman Fucker is a tool i made to screw over a bunch of asses
## What is it?
MediaHuman fucker is designed to get around the paywall of mediahuman's [Video Converter](https://www.mediahuman.com/video-converter/5/) Paywall. The program gives you 20 files, then you need to pay $15 (once) to use it.
## Why?
The video converter isnt converting shit. It basically combines the binaries of [ffmpeg]("https://ffmpeg.org") with a shitty MacOS-like UI. FFmpeg requires you to credit ffmpeg if you use their software. FFmpeg Contributors deserve 10k a month for what they do. Yet they do it for free. Almost all big apps use FFmpeg at one point or another. Some programs and services you may have heard of:
- Adobe
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Wondershit
- Youtube
- VLC? (though they contribute to ffmpeg alot, they arent bad.)
- Discord
- Meta
- Netflix
- Hulu
- Max
- Disney +
- TikTok
  And countless others all rely on those 800k code files for their companies. If a program you know processes media: audio, video, images, subtitles, then there is a 99.9999999999% chance it uses ffmpeg. Most of these companies give credit. MediaHuman? No credit at all.
  ## Why not go for a bigger company like Wondershit or Adobe?
  A few reasons.
  - Adobe products are all over the place
  - Wondershit and Adobe have hard to crack security measures
  - MediaHuman stores the value in a registry key.
